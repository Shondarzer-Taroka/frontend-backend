# Help Center API

## Description

This project is a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express.js. It allows users to manage "Help Center" cards, which represent different sections of a help center, such as "Branches," "Manage Your Account," and "Manage Billing." Users can create, retrieve, and search for these cards.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local or cloud setup like MongoDB Atlas)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/help-center-api.git
cd help-center-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
USER_ID=your_mongodb_user_id
USER_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
PORT=6699 # or any port you prefer
```

### 4. Start the MongoDB Server
Ensure your MongoDB server is running. If you're using MongoDB Atlas (cloud), you can skip this step.

### 5. Run the Server
Start the Node.js server with the following command:

```bash
npm start

```

If you want the server to reload automatically when files change, you can use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
### 6. Verify the Setup
Open your browser or use a tool like Postman to test the API by visiting:

```bash
http://localhost:6699
```

## Implementing Shared Functionality Across a Component Tree

To share functionality across a component tree in React, you can use the following approaches:

1. **Context API**:
   - The Context API allows you to share values or functions between components at different levels of the component tree without prop drilling. By creating a context with `React.createContext()` and wrapping your component tree with a `Provider`, you can provide and access shared values or functions using `useContext()`.

2. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Custom hooks are used to encapsulate reusable logic or state management that can be shared across multiple components. This approach helps keep components modular and maintainable by centralizing related functionality.

3. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**:
   - Higher-Order Components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality or props. HOCs allow you to enhance components by injecting shared functionality without modifying the original component.

## Why `useState` is Appropriate for Handling State in a Complex Component

The `useState` hook is suitable for managing state in complex components for several reasons:

1. **Local State Management**:
   - `useState` allows you to manage state within individual functional components, making it easier to keep state management localized and controlled.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - State managed by `useState` is confined to the component, which simplifies debugging and reduces dependencies on external state.

3. **Functional Updates**:
   - `useState` supports functional updates, which is beneficial when the new state depends on the previous state, ensuring correct state transitions.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Using `useState` ensures that only the component that owns the state re-renders when the state changes, avoiding unnecessary re-renders of other components and optimizing performance.

5. **Simplicity and Clarity**:
   - The hook provides a straightforward API for managing state in functional components, contributing to cleaner and more maintainable code.
